    <p>The lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostris) is a species of shark from the family Carcharhinidae and is classified
        as a Vulnerable species by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Lemon sharks can grow to 3.4
        metres (11 ft) in length. They are often found in shallow subtropical waters and are known to inhabit and return
        to specific nursery sites for breeding. Often feeding at night, these sharks use electroreceptors to find their
        main source of prey, fish. Lemon sharks enjoy the many benefits of group living such as enhanced communication,
        courtship, predatory behavior, and protection. This species of shark gives birth to live young, and the females
        are polyandrous and have a biennial reproductive cycle. Lemon sharks are not thought to be a large threat to
        humans; there have been 10 recorded bites, none of which were life-threatening. The lemon shark's life span is
        unknown, but the average shark is 25 to 30 years old. The oldest recorded lemon shark in captivity died in 2023
        at the age of 40 years.</p>

    <p>Lemon sharks are found from New Jersey to southern Brazil in the tropical western Atlantic Ocean. They also live
        off the coast of west Africa in the southeastern Atlantic. In addition, lemon sharks have been found in the
        eastern Pacific, from southern Baja California to Ecuador and in Cape Verde in Sal Island. This species of shark
        often occupies the subtropical shallow waters of coral reefs, mangroves, enclosed bays, and river mouths;
        however, lemon sharks have also been found in the open ocean down to depths of 92 meters (301 feet.) Although
        lemon sharks do swim up rivers, they never seem to travel very far into fresh water. They are found in open
        water primarily during migrations, and tend to stay along the continental and insular shelves for most of their
        lives.</p>
