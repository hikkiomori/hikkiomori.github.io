    <h1><u>Sharks</u></h1>

    <p>Sharks are a group of elasmobranch fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton, five to seven gill slits on
        the sides of the head, and pectoral fins that are not fused to the head. Modern sharks are classified within the
        clade Selachimorpha (or Selachii) and are the sister group to the Batoidea (rays and kin). Some sources extend
        the term "shark" as an informal category including extinct members of Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fish) with a
        shark-like morphology, such as hybodonts. Shark-like chondrichthyans such as Cladoselache and Doliodus first
        appeared in the Devonian Period (419–359 million years), though some fossilized chondrichthyan-like scales are
        as old as the Late Ordovician (458–444 million years ago).[1] The oldest confirmed modern sharks (selachimorphs)
        are known from the Early Jurassic, about 200 million years ago, though records of true sharks may extend back as
        far as the Permian.</p>

    <p>DID YOU KNOW!!</p>

    <p>1-There are more than 500 species of sharks found in oceans around the world.</p>
    <p>2-Sharks breathe through a process called "ram ventilation", this process works by constantly forcing water over
        the gills, which in turn extract oxygen from the surrounding water and then expel carbon dioxide. In essence,
        this is how sharks are able to stay alive underwater.</p>
